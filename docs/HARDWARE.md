# RosePi Hardware Setup

This document provides an overview of the hardware setup required for the RosePi automated plant care system. Before getting started, make sure you have the necessary components and understand how to assemble them.

## Components

To build the RosePi system, you'll need the following components:

1. **Raspberry Pi:** You can use a Raspberry Pi 3 or later model as the core controller for your plant care system.

2. **Sensors:**
   - Soil Moisture Sensor: To monitor soil moisture levels.
   - Light Sensor: To measure light intensity.
   - Temperature and Humidity Sensor: For monitoring environmental conditions.
   - pH Sensor (if applicable): To measure soil or nutrient solution pH.

3. **Actuators:**
   - Water Pump: To control the flow of water for watering the plant.
   - LED Grow Lights: To provide additional or controlled lighting.

4. **Relays:** You'll need relays to control the water pump, LED lights, and other actuators using the Raspberry Pi GPIO pins.

5. **Power Supply:** Ensure you have an adequate power supply for the Raspberry Pi and all connected components.

6. **Containers or Pots:** Choose appropriate containers or pots for your plants, depending on your setup (e.g., soil-based, hydroponics, or aquaponics).

7. **Support Structures:** If necessary, prepare trellises, stakes, or other support structures to aid plant growth.

8. **Tubing and Connectors:** If you're using a water pump, you'll need tubing and connectors for the irrigation system.

9. **Optional Components:** Depending on the complexity of your project, you may need additional components, such as CO2 generators, fans, or other sensors.

## Wiring and Connections

When setting up your hardware, ensure that you connect the components correctly to the Raspberry Pi's GPIO pins. Use the GPIO pin layout for your specific Raspberry Pi model. Securely attach sensors and actuators, and take care to avoid any short circuits.

For specific wiring instructions, consult the datasheets and documentation provided with your components, as well as any tutorials or guides relevant to the sensors and actuators you're using.

## Power Considerations

Make sure your power supply is capable of providing enough power to run the Raspberry Pi and connected components. Insufficient power can lead to instability and malfunctions in the system.

## Safety Precautions

When dealing with water and electricity, safety is crucial. Ensure that all electrical connections are well-insulated, and avoid exposing components to moisture. Be cautious when working with water pumps and other electrical components in close proximity to plant containers.

## Additional Documentation

For more detailed instructions on assembling the hardware components and connecting them to your Raspberry Pi, refer to the relevant user manuals and guides provided with your sensors and actuators.
